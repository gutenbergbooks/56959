<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">THE FERN FLORA OF NEW YORK.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By B. D. Gilbert.</span></p>
<p>The State of New York has the largest area of any northern
State east of Michigan. It also possesses a great diversity of
surface, with its two mountain ranges, its numerous lakes, its interior
salt basin, and its seashore confined entirely to the
southern extremity. On its eastern side it stretches through
more than four degrees of north latitude, and as these are the
degrees just south of the 45th parallel, it is easy to understand
that there is liable to be a greater intermixture of northern and
southern forms of ferns than there would be in a State lying
farther south. And the fact is that certain species from the north
and others from the south do meet within its borders. This also
accounts for the large number of species found in the State: California
and Texas, the one State having four times the area of
New York, and the other five times that area, being the only ones
which contain as large or a larger number of species.</p>
<p>For the purpose of fern classification, the State may be divided
into four distinct zones, as follows:</p>
<p>I. <span class="sc">The Littoral.</span>&mdash;This comprises Long Island and Staten
Island. Only one fern is peculiar to this zone, viz. <i>Woodwardia
angustifolia</i>; but there are two Lycopods, viz. <i>L. alopecuroides</i>
and its variety <i>adpressum</i>.</p>
<p>II. <span class="sc">The Catskill Mountain Region</span>, extending down to
Manhattan Island.&mdash;This being the southern mountain range of
the State, it is here that three southern species find their
northern limit, viz. <i>Asplenium Bradleyi</i>, <i>A. montanum</i> and
<i>Cheilanthes vestita</i>. It may be a question whether the Connecticut
stations for <i>Asplenium montanum</i> lie farther north than the
New York stations, but it is certain that there can be but little
difference between them in this respect.</p>
<p>III. <span class="sc">The Adirondack Region</span>, extending as far south as
Little Falls.&mdash;Here there are a few of the northern species that
descend to their southern limit in this country. Among them may
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
be mentioned <i>Nephrodium fragrans</i>, <i>Polystichum Braunii</i>, <i>Woodsia
glabella</i>, and <i>W. hyperborea</i>. There are also two Lycopods
to be included in this list, <i>L. annotinum pungens</i> and <i>L. Sitchense</i>.</p>
<p>IV. <span class="sc">The Western Region</span>, extending from the mountain
regions to the State&rsquo;s western boundary, the southern part
drained by the Susquehanna and its tributaries, and the northern
part containing (a) <i>The Salt Basin</i> of Syracuse and its vicinity,
the home of <i>Scolopendrium</i> and <i>Botrychium Onondagense</i>, and
(b) <i>The Central Basin</i>, extending from Little Falls to Oneida
Lake, and drained by the Mohawk River, being famous for its
large number of <i>Botrychia</i>, some of which seem to be almost,
if not quite, peculiar to this region.</p>
<p>In the preparation of this list I have consulted various local
floras and other reports of the State, especially Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Catalogue
of Plants Found in Oneida County and Vicinity;&rdquo; the Annual
Reports of the State Botanist, &ldquo;The Flora of the Upper
Susquehanna,&rdquo; and the files of the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span>. I have also
been favored with many notes from the State Herbarium sheets
by Professor Peck himself; while my own herbarium and that of
Dr. J. V. Haberer, of Utica, have been exceedingly useful in fixing
definite localities.</p>
<p>The plan I have followed is to include along with the species
only such varieties as seem to be most important and distinct.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush in <i>The Torrey Bulletin</i> for June, 1903, enumerates
59 species and varieties of ferns found in Texas. This compares
well with our list of 64 species and varieties in New York State, of
which only 18 of these are common to both States. Mr. Reverchon&rsquo;s
list for Texas, published in the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span>, April, 1903, gives
51 ferns and 15 allies, or 66 in all. The present list includes 53
species and 12 varieties of ferns, and 23 species and 7 varieties
of fern allies. If we take Bush&rsquo;s ferns and Reverchon&rsquo;s allies,
there are 74 species and varieties known in Texas, or 20 less than
I have enumerated in New York.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">FERNWORT NOTES&mdash;IV.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Willard N. Clute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Nephrodium Molle in Florida.</span>&mdash;Mr. James H. Ferriss recently
called my attention to specimens of <i>Nephrodium molle</i> received
from Florida with the suggestion that this species might
be native to the State. On this point, Reasoner Brothers, the
well-known plant dealers, have written him that they no longer
grow the fern since it is abundant in a wild state and easily obtained
when wanted. There seems to be no reason why the
species should not occur in Florida, since <i>Nephrodium patens</i>,
a close ally, is common there; but as <i>N. Molle</i> is not listed
from the United States, we publish this note in the hope of
drawing out further information about it and of ascertaining if
possible whether <i>Molle</i> is actually native, or only a well naturalized
escape. Superficially, <i>molle</i> and <i>patens</i> are so very much
alike that it is very easy to confuse them. The venation, however,
is a sufficiently distinct feature. In <i>patens</i> the basal veins in
each pinnule run to the sinus, uniting at, or just below, it; in
<i>molle</i> they unite at some distance from the sinus from whence
a single vein runs to the sinus. According to Jenman, <i>patens</i>
has a creeping horizontal rootstock with the fronds arranged in
two lines along it, while <i>molle</i> has an erect rootstock. The
fronds of the latter are also softer and thinner.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Naturalization of an Exotic Fern.</span>&mdash;Records of ferns becoming
naturalized in new regions are very rare. <i>Pteris serrulata</i>
is probably our most conspicuous American example, having
been found as an escape in several places, while it is known to
grow abundantly on old walls in New Orleans. I have also reported
the occurrence in the same place, of an abundance of
<i>Pteris longifolia</i> previously known in the United States from
Florida alone. In the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> for January, 1898, mention
is made of fronds of <i>Pteris tremula</i> seventeen inches high collected
from the walls of a tunnel in New York City, and the
same article mentions a Japanese species of <i>Athyrium</i> that has
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
become naturalized on Staten Island, New York. To this meagre
list, it is with much pleasure that I add another species in the
shape of the Japanese climbing fern (<i>Lygodium Japonicum</i>).
This Mrs. A. P. Taylor has sent to me from Thomasville, Georgia,
where she finds it in profusion along the sides of a deep ditch.
The station is not far from a greenhouse from whence the plants
doubtless came in the first place, but all indications point to a
further spread of this pretty and interesting species.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Forms of the Spinulose Wood Fern.</span>&mdash;It is well-known
to fern students that much more attention has been paid
to the forms of ferns on the other side of the Atlantic than on
this. Since the same species are often common to both localities,
it is but natural that the early students of American ferns should
pay rather more attention to the mere forms of species common
to Great Britain and America than their systematic importance
warrants. This is especially true of the variable <i>Nephrodium
spinulosum</i> whose variety <i>intermedium</i>, I am convinced, is
scarcely more than an ecological form. In this view I am glad
to be borne out by Mr. A. B. Klugh, who has recently examined
nearly 500 Canadian specimens and come to the same conclusion.
Mr. Klugh writes: &ldquo;In number of glands on the indusium, in
color of scales on the stipe, in shape and cutting of the frond
and in degree of obliquity of the pinnae, we have a perfect
gradation from true <i>spinulosum</i> to typical <i>intermedium</i>. Our
commonest form has the indusium glandular and the scales of
the stipe pale brown without a dark centre.&rdquo; In a series of fronds
examined there seemed to be no corelation between the color of
the scales and the glands on the indusium, there being fronds
with light scales and no glands, others with dark centered scales
and many glands, and still others the exact opposites of these.
<i>Intermedium</i> may be distinguished as a form, but it is certainly
far less distinct than such plants as <i>Nephrodium cristatum
Clintonianum</i> or <i>Pteris aquilina pseudocaudata</i> and would probably
never have appeared in our lists but for the fact that much
has been made of the forms of this species in other lands.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Elevation and Lycopodium selago.</span>&mdash;Some time ago I noted
in this series, that a party of botanists on a visit to Mt. Ktaadn
had found <i>Lycopodium selago</i> grading into <i>L. lucidulum</i> as they
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
traveled downward from the summit, and quoted their opinion
that <i>L. selago</i> is a xerophytic form of <i>L. lucidulum</i>. In regard
to this, Mr. J. B. Flett writes that if the one intergrades with the
other, it is doubtless due to elevation or cold, and not to
xerophytic conditions. As to the plant&rsquo;s habitat in the northwest,
he says: &ldquo;I have never seen <i>L. selago</i> growing in a really dry place,
I have studied this form in the field from Washington through
British Columbia into the islands of southwestern Alaska and on
the Aleutian Islands, also on the tundra between Cape Nome and
Cape York. No one familiar with this tundra region would ever
assert that there are any xerotic forms on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At least four stations for the Harts-tongue fern are known
in the vicinity of Owen Sound in northwestern Ontario. Specimens
from these localities are rare in herbaria, and the writer is
fortunate in receiving specimens from near Collingwood, a
station twenty-three miles east of Owen Sound. This station
was first authentically reported by Mr. Osler and described by
Mr. Maxon in &ldquo;Fernwort Papers&rdquo; in 1900. These specimens
were collected by Dr. W. A. Bastedo and he describes the place
where they were collected as being five or six miles from Collingwood.
The plants were growing in a shady, though rather
open wood, along the course of a small stream. The altitude is
given as 1635 feet above sea-level. The plants at the time
of collection, July 17th, 1903, were nearly all young and even
the mature fronds are but five to eight inches in length, though
all of them are very broad for their length. Dr. Bastedo further
notes that in the recesses of the cliff, snow was still abundant
at that date. <i>Polystichum Lonchitis</i> and <i>Dryopteris Filix-mas</i>
were abundant and <i>Asplenium Trichomanes</i> and <i>Cryptogramma
Stelleri</i> were common upon the cliffs. This station is undoubtably
one of those described by Mr. Maxon in the neighborhood of
Collingwood. However, a careful search of this entire region is
very much to be desired, as it is probable that the fern has a
more general distribution in this region than is known at present.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">By A. A. Eaton.</span></p>
<p class="center">FIFTEENTH PAPER.
<br /><span class="sc">Varieties of E. Hiemale.</span></p>
<p>1. <i>Intermedium</i> A. A. Eaton. Stems 1 to 4 feet high, 1 to 4
lines in diameter, simple or ultimately branched, 20 to 30 angled,
rough with transverse bands of silex or becoming smoother by
a later deposit covering them; sheaths longer than broad, ampliated,
green excepting narrow black and white incurved limb, or
exceptionally with other black and white markings; leaves keeled
below the middle, flat and often centrally grooved above; teeth
thin, brown, hyaline-bordered, deciduous or persistent; anatomy
of <i>hiemale</i> as previously described. New York, Michigan
and westward. Common west of the Mississippi, being an
important forage crop in some States. The anomalous <i>laevigatum</i>
collected by Rydberg at Thedford, Neb., No. 1283 (Cont.
Nat. Herb. III, 194), is this variety, as is the plant referred to
under the name of <i>variegatum</i> by V. K. Chestnut (Cont. Nat.
Herb. VII, 304), as used for various unimportant purposes by
the Indians of Mendocino County, California. He also mentions
the fact that horses eat it even when grass is abundant.</p>
<p>2. <i>Texanum</i> Milde. Stems erect, very slender, somewhat
rough, 10 to 12 angled, hardly 1 foot high, dirty green; sheaths
elongated, slightly widened, 2 to 2 1-3 lines long and 1 1-3 wide,
concolorous, leaves flat, centrally grooved and 4 angled above
and centrally ridged below; teeth persistent, flexuous, white with
red-brown center, lance subulate, smooth, only the lowermost
three sheaths red-brown; ridges convex; carinal bast 7, vallecular
4, cells high, vallecular holes transverse oval; stomata rows
separated by 7 to 8 cells, grooves naked, lumen of epidermal
cells very wide, angles with broad, short bands, never with two
rows of tubercles. Texas, <i>Chas. Wright</i>.</p>
<p>This is Milde&rsquo;s description. I have never seen this plant.
Milde states that it is a very peculiar plant that equals the
weakest specimens of var. <i>Moorei</i>, but differs greatly from it,
and he asks if it may not be the young stage of a larger species.</p>
<p>3. <i>Herbaceum</i> var. nov. Cespitose, decumbent, ascending or
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
erect, 3 to 10 inches high, &frac12; to 1 line in diameter, 6 to 12 angled,
weak and herbaceous or becoming firmer the second year, usually
bearing a single branch 1 to 2 inches long at each node. Walls of
the stem thicker than in <i>hiemale</i>; ridges with long cross-bands;
grooves naked, except for small spots of silex on the cells;
sheaths elongated and very wide-spreading, with a narrow black
band at tip, otherwise green or (in dried specimens at least) all
suffused with black; leaves 3-angled or flat in the middle above,
rarely bearing a central groove; teeth fuscous, flexuous, deciduous,
leaving a hard, horny, centrally grooved erect or incurved,
usually shining, borderless leaf base &frac12; its height; spikes narrowly
elliptical, rounded, not apiculate. <i>Coville &amp; Funston</i>, 1297,
Death Valley Exp., banks of Kaweah river at Three Rivers,
Tulare Co., Calif., July 26, 1891 (Nat. Herb., 25, 101), as
<i>variegatum</i>. Three little plants, 3 inches high, well fruited
(Cont. Nat. Mus. IV, 226). <i>C. &amp; F.</i>, 1042, 1 mile south of Kernville,
Kern Co., Calif., on north fork of Kern river, Alt., 750
meters, June 23, 1901, as <i>variegatum</i> (Nat. Herb., 25100).</p>
<p>In some of its characters, such as sheaths and persistent, incurved
leaf-bases, this plant resembles <i>Funstoni</i>, but the section
is similar to <i>hiemale</i>. An abundance of material might show this
to be a good species. The only thing I have seen that approaches
it in texture is <i>E. Sieboldi</i> Milde from Japan, which is even more
grass-like.</p>
<p>4. <i>Pumilum</i> var. nov. Cespitose; stems in a dense cluster,
6 to 15 inches tall, 8 to 16 angled, &frac12; to 1 line in diameter, mostly
geniculate at the lower nodes, nearly all the joints tumid, the
lower gibbous; ridges with cross-bands of silex, grooves naked;
sheaths tight, often symmetrical through the tumidity of the
node, narrowest in the middle except where nodes are normal,
bearing a broad black band below and a narrower black limb,
the two separated by a pinkish or dirty white band which is
often suffused with black or even entirely black towards the
top of the stem, fading to dirty ashy the second year, ultimately
splitting, recurving and falling off in patches; leaves linear,
erect, prominently 3-angled, the central one sometimes grooved
on the smallest stems and branches; teeth persistent, dark
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
brown, somewhat flexuous, white-bordered for 1-5 to 1-4 their
height.</p>
<p>Found at intervals for a mile along the railroad grade at
North Hampton, N. H. At the foot of the grade, in moist soil
near a brook, probably from the same source as this, a form of
<i>affine</i> grows, but the joints are often tumid and occasionally
geniculate, the branches when present like stems of this, tumid
jointed, often so gibbous as to rupture the sheath. Peculiar for
its small cespitose stems, dark sheaths and especially the tumid
or gibbous nodes, which make the stems thickest there, while
usually the nodes are contracted.</p>
<p>This is near the European variety <i>viride</i> Milde, but differs in
having bands on the ridges, no rosul&aelig; in the grooves, and in
the tumid joints.</p>
<p>5. <i>Suksdorfi</i> var. nov. Stems 1 to 2&frac12; feet high, 1 to 3
lines wide, about 24 angled, rough, with cross-walls of silex,
rarely with ends elevated to two rows of tubercles; stomata in
single rows, rarely double for a short distance, each stoma connected
at top and bottom with its opposite by rows of rosul&aelig;
formed by the silex bands of the grooves throwing up tubercles
on each cell of the epidermis, which open at top to circular
jagged disks, these often obscured later by a washing of silex, but
always shown near the tops of the stems and on the branches;
sheaths elongated, cylindrical, tight, black, developing a ring of
tawny white which gradually increases till it occupies the whole
sheath except a narrow black basal ring and a narrow black
limb formed by the horny tips of the leaves; leaves linear, narrowed
above the middle, the lower 2-3 keeled, the upper third
flat, rarely with a narrow carinal groove above, tipped with a
small, black, horny, hyaline-bordered point; teeth articulated to
the leaves, black-centered, soon fading, withering and deciduous.</p>
<p>Anatomy of <i>hiemale</i>, the carinal bast elongated along the dissepiment,
the vallecular much smaller but often similar in shape.
Upper 1 to 3 nodes bearing 1 to 4 branches each, which overtop
the stem and bear contemporaneous spikelets.</p>
<p>This would be a noteworthy variety even if it bore no branches.
It is the only American form of <i>heimale</i> known to me, except
occasionally <i>intermedium</i> which bears branches with the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
effort of growth. All the others develop them, if at all, after
the stem has ceased to grow, and the vegetative energy, having
no other outlet, pushes out a few of the latent buds lying
between the ridges at the nodes.</p>
<p>Bingen, Wash. High bottom land on the Columbia river.
<i>W. N. Suksdorf</i>, September 3, 1902, No. 2161.</p>
<p>6. <i>Drummondi</i> (Milde) <i>C. robustum Drummondi</i> Milde,
Mon. Equis. 593. Fertile stems 3 feet high, 16 angled; sheaths
short, the lowest fuscous; teeth persistent, white, crispate; stomata
often of 1 to 3 lines to a series, which are separated by
4 to 6 cells.</p>
<p>Collected by Drummond at the Brazos river in Texas. It is
very aberrant, but is placed here on account of its anatomy. I
have not seen specimens of this.</p>
<p>7. <i>Affine</i> (<i>Eng.</i>) (<i>E. robustum affine Eng.</i>) <i>E. hiemale</i> of
American authors, not L. Stems 18 to 30 inches high, 2 to 5 lines
in diameter, finely 16 to 40 angled, dark green, angles with broad
bands of silex, rarely with two rows of tubercles. Internodes
when dry contracted above and below, widest in the middle as
in <i>hiemale</i>, scurfy when young; sheaths longer than broad, at
first with a black limb, developing a broad ashy band and narrow
black basal ring, fading, rupturing and deciduous the second
or third year; leaves narrowly linear, sharply 3 angled, the
central ridges only rarely centrally grooved except on the
branches, where they usually are; commissural groove very narrow,
not widened upward; teeth articulated to the sheaths, persistent
or usually cohering by their tips and torn off by the growth
of the stem, those of each sheath shaped like a candle extinguisher,
all telescoped together and borne up on the tip of the
stem.</p>
<p>Very common in New England and the east generally, where
the type of <i>robustum</i> is absent. Toward the west it runs into
the next, but it is occasionally found, even to the valley of
Mexico (Pringle 3329). Approaches typical <i>hiemale</i> in its long
sheaths and size, and differs little except in the cross-bands of
silex. Found usually in moist sand near a watercourse; at
times on high sandy banks. It is by no means certain that this
is the variety described by Engelmann under this name, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
from the brief description he gives it seems safe to assume that
it is. Two branched forms are found, as follows:</p>
<p>a. <i>Forma ramosum</i> f. nov. (f. <i>Ramigerum</i> A. A. E., in
Gilbert&rsquo;s list, p. 26, not A. Br. in Sched., which normally branches
at the 3 to 5 middle nodes.) Stems issuing one to several
branches from the upper nodes after the death of the top of the
main axis; teeth usually persistent and leaves centrally grooved.
b. <i>Forma polystachyum</i> Prager. Stems issuing small spiciferous
branches late in the season. As remarked by Mr. Gilbert (List,
p. 26), these forms are seldom found together and many patches
show neither.</p>
<p>The stems of this variety persist at least three years and
probably longer. I have found but two causes of death, old age
not appearing as a factor. Both are fungoid. After the stem has
persisted for a time small white patches appear under the epidermis
of the upper internode. These increase in number and the
internode finally dies, not, however, till the second one shows
the disease. This may continue till the whole stem succumbs.
The other fungus is a smut that breaks out in small pustules,
finally opening in black patches the size of the head of a pin or
smaller. They are usually numerous and the stem dies rapidly.</p>
<p>The growth of the stem is indeterminate, but as each succeeding
section is a little smaller than the one below, the time arrives
in the history of each when no more can be pushed out and the
growth ceases. The undeveloped internodes soon die and thus
the stem, if it grows at all, must put its energy into branches,
as the silex coating prevents its increase in diameter.</p>
<p>9. <i>Robustum</i> (A. Br.) <i>E. robustum</i> A. Br. Stems 3 to 6 feet
tall, 2 to 6 lines wide, 16 to 48 angled, simple or branched the
second year; ridges rough with cross-bands of silex; grooves
naked with a smooth coat of silex, and when young with a thin
white scurfy coat that soon falls off; sheaths tight to the stem,
or recurved and deciduous in fragments in age, as broad as
long, soon developing a black girdle at base, an ashy or pinkish
one through the middle and a black one above, the last usually
very small, all variable in breadth and intensity of color; leaves
linear, sharply 3 angled; commissural groove not widened above;
teeth more or less persistent for a season, seldom torn off by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
growth of the stem, articulated to the leaves, cohering, in
groups, brown centrally, with tawny margins &frac12; their height, ending
in filiform usually flexuous appendages, the edges beset
with unicellular bristles; branches variable in number and length,
the sheaths mostly like those of the stem except the teeth always
persist and the leaves are usually grooved centrally; spikes
usually green, oval, up to an inch long and half as wide, sharply
apiculate. <i>Ramosum</i> and <i>polystachyum</i> forms occur in this as
well as in <i>affine</i>.</p>
<p>Rare east of the Mississippi, where it is replaced by var.
<i>affine</i>. Very common west, where it has been reported from nearly
every State. I have seen it from but six localities in the
Eastern States, Wallingford, Pa., <i>T. C. Palmer</i>; Towson, Md.,
<i>C. E. Waters</i>; Peoria, Ill., <i>F. E. McDonald</i>; Illinois, without locality,
<i>Dr. Brendell</i>; Mattsville, Ind., <i>Guy Wilson</i>; Sarnia, Mich.,
<i>C. K. Dodge</i>; accredited to New Jersey by Milde, and also found
in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Var. <i>minus</i> Eng. is simply the same thing reduced, often growing
with it. As there is already a variety <i>minus</i> of <i>hiemale</i> this
name will not stand, and the form is of too little moment to merit
another.</p>
<p>Stems of this can usually be recognized at a glance, but it is
hard to embody the description in words that will enable one to
separate it from <i>affine</i> at once. From <i>Californicum</i> it can only
be separated by use of a lens, as their appearance is identical.</p>
<p>10. <i>Californicum</i> Milde. Plants of various appearance, now 15
inches high and 4 lines wide, now 7&frac12; to 8 feet tall and 8 lines
wide, 25-40 angled; the ridges with two distinct rows of tubercles
or occasionally with transverse bands of silex, the grooves
abundantly supplied with rosul&aelig;, either in regular rows or scattered,
often indistinct on old stems because of a heavy deposit of
silex; sheaths as broad as long, with a broad or narrow black or
dark brown ring just above the base, an ashy band in the middle
and another usually narrow dark band at top. In young plants
the sheaths are usually concolorous with the stem save for the
terminal band; leaves linear, 3-angled with two rows of tubercles
on the middle angle; commissural groove narrow, slightly or not
at all widened above; teeth persistent, dark brown, firm, united
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
two-thirds their height by brown borders; or brown-centered,
flexuous, membranous-bordered, united or free, or early deciduous,
leaving only a small dark brown spot at the tip of the leaves;
branches none or few, short or up to 18 inches long, fruited or
not, on the upper part of old stems.</p>
<p>Type. California <i>Balfour</i>, 1854. I have seen it from the following
localities: California: Sacramento, <i>Wilkes Exp.</i> (Sheaths
black, teeth persistent, near var. <i>Javanicum</i>); Berkeley, <i>W. C.
Blasdale</i> (very stout, often with two rows of stomata); San
Rafael, <i>Munson &amp; Hopkins</i> (like last, but with one row of
stomata). Arizona: Cedar Ranch, <i>MacDougal</i>. Nevada: Humboldt
Mts., <i>Watson</i>. Utah: Fish Lake, <i>Jones</i>; Glenwood, <i>Ward</i>.
Idaho: Peter Creek, <i>Sandberg</i>; Salmon, <i>Henderson</i>. Oregon:
Port Discovery, <i>Wilkes Exp.</i> Washington: Tacoma, <i>Flett</i>;
Klickitat Co., <i>Suksdorf</i>. British Columbia: New Westminster,
<i>A. J. Hill</i>. (No rosul&aelig;, occasionally two rows of stomata, extraordinarily
thick coating of silex.)</p>
<p>Except the Berkeley and San Rafael plants these can be told
from <i>robustum</i> only by aid of the microscope to see the tubercles
and rosul&aelig;. Though specimens vary considerably in appearance,
the presence or absence of teeth, the size and intensity
of the rings, a parallel can usually be found in a good series
of <i>robustum</i>.</p>
<p>11. <i>Doelli.</i> Stems 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; feet high, erect, dark green, 10
to 20 angled, the ridges with two rows of tubercles or short
crossbands, the former predominating; grooves with irregular
rows of rosettes; sheaths entirely black or with a narrow ashy
band which is broader the second year; the leaves plainly 4
angled through the grooving of the central ridge; teeth persistent
or becoming broken in age, rigid, erect, dark brown or black,
grooved in the center, with narrow white margins and usually
deciduous filiform tips. Somewhat resembles a robust <i>E. trachyodon</i>,
which it is quite near.</p>
<p>Type European. British Columbia, near Wharnock Station,
<i>A. J. Hill</i>; Vancouver, <i>Macoun</i> (as <i>ramosissimum</i>); Blacktail
Deer Creek, Yellowstone Park, <i>Knowlton</i>. The latter is quite
peculiar in appearance and approaches <i>robustum</i>. None of the
specimens exactly agree, but will come here better than elsewhere.

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">THE SPECIES-CONCEPTION AMONG THE TERNATE BOTRYCHIUMS.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Willard N. Clute.</span></p>
<p>Living as I do in the midst of a region rich in specimens of
the ternate <i>Botrychiums</i>, I have taken more than ordinary interest
in the discussion of the relative rank to which the various
forms should be assigned. After considerable study of the subject
which has consisted of a careful balancing of the degree of
differentiation in each form, as well as an examination of much
material both in the herbarium and in the field, I have come to
certain conclusions which I purpose to set down here.</p>
<p>Before the separate forms are discussed it may be well to say
a few words on the variations of <i>Botrychium ternatum</i> in general.
It is a noticeable fact that all the so-called new species of this
section of the genus, have been based primarily upon the cutting
of the sterile part of the frond. This is all the more remarkable
since there are probably no other genera in which species are
founded on the minor outlines of a mere leaf. One has but to
turn to nature in any clime to see that leaves are not invariably
of the same shape. Note the wide variation in the moonseed, the
hollyhock, the sassafras, and some of the buttercups among
flowering plants, and if it be contended that the cases are not
parallel, take as further illustration the blood-root, which, like
the <i>Botrychium</i>, produces but one leaf a year, and note the cutting
of its single leaf. If all these forms of <i>Botrychium</i> are
species, why have not the forms of the bloodroot been segregated?
Moreover, if we are to recognize these forms of <i>Botrychium</i> as
species, why should we not also recognize as such the three
hundred forms of <i>Athyrium filix-foemina</i>, or the hundred or
more forms of <i>Scolopendrium</i>? It is unavailing to say that these
latter are mere gardeners&rsquo; varieties, for we have it on the
authority of Mr. Druery, who is familiar with them all, that a
large number come true from spores.</p>
<p>Experiments with flowering plants have shown that the
thickness of leaves and the amount of cutting of their edges,
may be altered by different degrees of moisture, sunshine, etc., to
which they are exposed, and we may infer as much for the ferns.
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
This being so, it is not difficult to account for the slight variations
in cutting exhibited in plants from widely separated points
in the United States.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible to follow the latest writer on the
subject, and consider each extreme of variation a distinct species,
but I do not agree with him in the opinion that the naming of
varieties is a stupid practice, nor do I see that it necessarily follows
that because a species was named <i>Japonicum</i> from Japanese
specimens that we must infer that its centre of distribution is in
Japan. As I understand it, to take a familiar example, <i>B. ternatum</i>
stands for a plant possessing certain characters no matter
where found. If we should find another <i>Botrychium</i> that differed
from this in some specific way, it would be correct to call it another
species; but if it showed minor differences, slightly thicker
or thinner leaves, a longer or shorter stipe, a little deeper notching
of the leaves, etc.&mdash;all characters that vary with the locality&mdash;then
it would seem more properly referred as a variety of the
first species.</p>
<p>As I have noted in this journal there are certain slight differences
between the Japanese <i>B. ternatum</i> and our familiar
species of Eastern America, but these are not enough, I now believe,
to make them two separate species, since all the differences
are found in the texture and cutting of the sterile part of the
frond. Under such circumstances I would arrange our American
forms as follows:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Botrychium ternatum obliquum</span> (<i>B. obliquum Muhl.</i>). The
common form in the North Atlantic States.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. t. obliquum</span> forma <span class="small">DISSECTUM</span> (<i>B. dissectum</i> Spreng.).
An exact duplicate of the preceding form in everything except
the cutting of the pinnules. These latter characterized by a
paucity of tissue between the terminal veins. Has the same
habitat and range, and the same peculiarity of waiting until July
or later before putting up its leaf for the season. No more entitled
to specific rank than the &ldquo;cut leaved&rdquo; birch or elder.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. t. obliquum</span> forma <span class="small">INTERMEDIUM</span> (<i>B. obliquum intermedium</i>
Unde.). I would call this a mere form, comparable to
any of the chance varieties of <i>Athyrium filix-foemina</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. t. obliquum</span> forma <span class="small">COULTERI</span> (<i>B. Coulteri</i> Unde.). A
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
western form rather more fleshy than that of the East. Grows
in geyser formations which may account for the difference in its
appearance.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. t. obliquum</span> forma <span class="small">OCCIDENTALE</span> (<i>B. occidentale</i> Unde.).
Closely related to the preceding, and, in my opinion, a phase of it.
Both good representatives of the western form.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. ternatum Oneidense</span> (<i>B. ternatum</i> var. <i>Oneidense</i> Gilbert).
This, the most strongly marked of the forms in the Atlantic
States failed to receive a place in the recently published index
to the described species of <i>Botrychium</i>. It can be distinguished
at a glance in field or herbarium by its broad and slightly
divided pinnules, and is very common in central New York.
The fronds, notwithstanding their broad pinnules, are among the
smallest of the group. If any of our forms of <i>Botrychium</i> are
entitled to sub-specific rank, this is certainly the one.</p>
<p><span class="sc">B. ternatum silaifolium</span> (<i>B. silaifolium</i> Presl.). This is
also mainly a western form. To it, however, I would refer the
plant recently described by Mr. Gilbert as <i>B. obliquum Habereri</i>
from central New York. I have examined the type specimen
and in my opinion it agrees perfectly with specimens of <i>silaifolium</i>
from California identified by Dr. Underwood. Even the
striations produced in the pinnae by drying appear identical. I
should call this a sub-species, as it does not approach the type as
closely as the others.</p>
<p>So little is known about <i>B. biternatum</i> Unde. and <i>B. tenuifolium</i>
Unde. that I shall not attempt to place them. Judging from
what I have seen of the latter, and I have seen numerous plants
in the field, I should consider it a form of <i>obliquum</i> and I suspect
that <i>biternatum</i> will prove to be based upon aberrant plants
of this which have fruited in spring instead of autumn. In regard
to this, Mr. W. W. Ashe has recently informed me that many
spring-flowering southern plants do not flower in the North
until late summer. It is possible our ferns may have similar
changes in their fruiting season.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">NEW FORMS OF FERNS.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Charles T. Druery</span>, F.L.S.</p>
<p>The editorial note appended to my short article in the April
issue of <span class="sc">The Bulletin</span> rather takes my breath away, as I never
imagined that an answer to my query could &ldquo;depend somewhat
upon whether we admire ferns for pure leaves or whether we
collect them for study.&rdquo; No true fern lover in either case would
knowingly destroy one of Nature&rsquo;s own novelties in the way I
described by denuding it repeatedly of its fronds for herbarium
purposes in situ, when by removing and cultivating it he could
also, in either case, not only gratify his own special taste more
fully, but could afford much gratification to a host of other fern
lovers of either class. That &ldquo;students of ferns know that many
fern forms are due to varying conditions of soil, light, moisture,
etc., and are inclined to pay very little attention to them&rdquo; I accept
at once, ranking myself with them; but advanced students
also know that many forms are not demonstrably due to such
influences, and amongst these forms are all those which claim
so much attention in this side of the ocean. The former are,
as the editor puts it, &ldquo;variants,&rdquo; the latter true varieties, and
so far as they are of Nature&rsquo;s own shaping, i. e., wild finds, as
distinct from improved selected types from the spores, they have
at least as much right to recognition in fern literature as the
normals. Hence it is to be regretted that a unique form of the
Christmas fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>) should exist in
the possession of a member of the Fern Chapter for ten years,
and, yet, never be described. What have the other members
done that such interesting data to some of them should be withheld?</p>
<p>The reference to seven-toed kittens and two-headed rabbits,
as fair parallels to the finest fern varieties in the mind of the
average student, is a poor compliment to the student who would
certainly benefit by a better acquaintance with the plumose section
of varieties at any rate. With the many botanists stated to
exist in the States who &ldquo;prefer a wild rose to all the gardeners&rsquo;
many-petalled creations&rdquo; I have more sympathy, but here comes
in the old botanical mistake embodied in the term &ldquo;garden forms&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
of ferns as applied to all varieties, with the wild finds of which
the gardeners have had nothing whatever to do. What would
such a botanist do if in his rambles among the wild roses he came
across a Marechal Niel as a wild sport? That is a fair parallel
to some of our best wild finds as compared with the normal
types, and he would be a singular man, I opine, in more senses
than one, if he turned up his nose at it as a mere variant and
held his tongue for ten years without describing it. I am gratified
to the editor for holding all his abnormal specimens at my
disposal, but, reading between the lines, I fear they would
embrace no acquisitions from my point of view, or he would not
be so ready to part with them. I hope sooner or later he will
come across a thoroughbred and become thereby a convert to my
theory, that constant and symmetrical variations are fully as
much, if not more, entitled to both lay and scientific attention
than the normal specific forms from which, by some occult
process, they arise under natural conditions.</p>
<p>[It is doubtless as difficult for Mr. Druery to understand our
position in this matter as it is to understand his. How a <i>student</i>
of ferns can care for what might be termed abnormal variations
is beyond our comprehension. The student is always interested
in normal variations, if we may so describe the common, slight
variations in form and texture due principally to ecological
factors; in fact, it is necessary that we take all such into account
in order to get a correct average of the species; but to give serious
attention to forked, crested, plumed, tasselled and befrizzled
specimens of ferns, which are manifestly due to the slipping of
a cog somewhere in Nature&rsquo;s machinery, is quite out of the
question. We grant that some of these attain forms that merit
admiration for their beauty, or oddity, as showing what Nature
can do in the way of leaves, but we maintain that were these
forms animal, instead of vegetable, they would excite only
feelings of repulsion. Now, the student of fern species is quite
inclined to think of these &ldquo;freaks,&rdquo; as he calls them, much as
others would if they <i>were</i> animal. The botanist may admire
the form, hue and perfume of the gardener&rsquo;s rose, but this is not
the rose he cares to study. In the early numbers of <span class="sc">The Fern
Bulletin</span>, upward of sixty American ferns have been put on
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
record as bearing forked or tasselled fronds, and so far as the
editor is aware, not one of these has been taken into cultivation
and only a very few have been given names. This fact will probably
explain our position to some extent. When the editor has
leisure, he is going to dig up every one of these variants in his
own locality and send them to Mr. Druery, in anticipation of
which it would be well for the latter to consult his gardener and
glazier about an extension to his ferneries.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">FERNS IN BOTTLES.</span></h2>
<p>A correspondent sends us the following clipping from the
<i>Westminster Gazette</i>. We are unable to vouch for its accuracy,
but as it may give some cultivator a hint we reprint it in full.</p>
<p>In a beautiful garden at Crouch End, belonging to one of
the few old world bowers which have withstood the tempting
offers of the building speculator, may be seen one of the queerest
freaks that Nature has ever played in park or garden. About
three years ago a long row of glass ginger bottles were placed
neck downward in the ground, with a few inches of the other end
projecting to form a border for the kitchen garden paths. Each
of these bottles now contains a fairy-like resident in the shape
of a dainty little fern, perfect in form and color, and of many
varieties, the ribbon fern and hart&rsquo;s-tongue predominating. As
no ferns had at any time been planted in that part of the garden
it is amazing how they got there. Perhaps Nature thought it
foolish to waste so many little natural hothouses, and put in each
a pinch of the stuff she makes ferns of. If so, she must view
with much pride the result of her experiment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Miss Angie M. Ryon, Niantic, Conn., reports finding fine
plants of <i>Ophioglossum vulgatum</i> upon a very rocky hillside,
the roots crowding themselves between the bits of rock that had
been broken up by loads of heavy timber passing over them the
previous year. The plants were exposed to the full rays of the
sun for most of the day.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">WILLIAM RALPH MAXON.</span></h2>
<p>William Ralph Maxon, whose portrait is presented this
month, first saw the light at Oneida, N.Y., on Feb. 27, 1877,
where his parents reside. He graduated at Oneida High School
in the class of 1894. From there he went to Syracuse University,
where he took the degree of Ph. B. in 1898. The bent of his
mind was toward botany and almost immediately after graduating
he went to New York and was employed for a few months in
the herbarium of the Botanical Garden at Bronx Park. From
there he went to Washington and took a temporary position in
the U.S. National Museum. But in August, 1899, as the result
of a Civil Service examination, he received the appointment of
Aid in Cryptogamic Botany in that institution, and still retains
that position.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxon joined the Fern Chapter in 1895, served as its
secretary for the year 1899, and as president of the Chapter for
the two years 1900 and 1901. He is a member of the Botanical
Society of Washington, of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and of two other local societies in
Washington. He has published several valuable papers on
botanical subjects, among which are &ldquo;A List of the Ferns and
Fern Allies of North America north of Mexico;&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Occurrence
of the Hart&rsquo;s-tongue in America,&rdquo; which formed his
presidential address before the Fern Chapter at its meeting in
New York in 1900; &ldquo;A Study of Certain Mexican and Guatemalan
Species of Polypodium&rdquo;; besides several shorter papers
containing descriptions of new species, including a continued
series in the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> entitled &ldquo;Notes on American Ferns.&rdquo;
For a young man Mr. Maxon has done some notably good work,
and his position in the National Museum is one which will give
him exceptional opportunities for original work in the future.&mdash;<i>B. D. Gilbert.</i></p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">ANOTHER STATION FOR ASPLENIUM EBENEUM HORTONAE.</span></h2>
<p>It affords me much pleasure to report another station for
the remarkable fern now known as <i>Asplenium ebeneum Hortonae</i>.</p>
<p>A single fine specimen some eight or ten inches high was discovered
by Miss K. A. French at the base of a ledge in Pittsford,
Vt. No sign of fertility is discernible in the old fronds decaying
about the base, the season&rsquo;s growth or the newer fronds stretching
up indoors. Whence came this beautiful variation in the
midst of type specimens galore?&mdash;<i>G. A. Woolson, Pittsford Mills,

<p>The editor of this journal is again away from home, which
will explain any delays in his correspondence. Letters intended
for him and sent to the usual address will be forwarded at
once.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>Every time the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> is late, doubtless half the
subscribers wonder what the editor can be doing to prevent
the magazine from appearing on time. The editor, therefore,
rises to explain that this publication would always be issued
promptly if correspondents would send in copy in season. We
endeavor to have each issue ready for the printer <i>a month before
publication</i>, and yet there are many of our contributors, who,
having arranged for space in a number, will wait until two or
three days before the publication date to send in copy. There is
too much matter in the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> for it to be printed,
bound and mailed in one day&mdash;or in one week for that matter&mdash;and
we simply cannot appear on time if we have to wait for copy.
We trust that contributors will bear this in mind and co-operate
with us in future in this matter of promptness.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>In this number, all subscribers whose subscriptions are not
paid in advance, will find a bill for the next volume, and the
amount in arrears, if any. There are so few who stop their subscriptions
after once becoming members of the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span>
circle of readers that to save all from the possible loss of a number
between the expiration and renewal of subscription, we continue
to send the magazine until ordered to stop. Those who do
not wish to be considered subscribers for the new volume should
notify us at once. In view of the liberal terms upon which the
publication is sent, we trust that we may continue to count all our
present subscribers among our readers for another year.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>The new volume of this magazine will be along the lines of
its predecessors. The Fern-floras of the States will be continued,
those for California and Florida being expected to appear early
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
in the year, followed by others now in preparation. The series
of portraits of fern students will be discontinued for the present,
to make room for a new series on exotic ferns in which will be
illustrated the ferns of unusual appearance from other lands, together
with descriptive notes upon their haunts and habits. In
nearly every fern collector&rsquo;s herbarium are species of which
little more than the name is known. It is expected that this
series will add much to our knowledge of these. Mr. Eaton&rsquo;s
<i>Equisetum</i> articles will be finished during the year. Other features
of the publication will be continued. A cordial invitation
is extended to every reader to contribute notes and articles of
interest.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>When one&rsquo;s herbarium has grown so bulky that it cannot be
looked through in an hour or so, and especially when it contains
numerous sheets of the same species, it often becomes a puzzling
question what to show the non-scientific visitor who wants to
see the ferns, but who has no interest in the slight differences
that separate closely related forms. To fit such cases we would
suggest the formation of an &ldquo;oh, my!&rdquo; collection&mdash;a collection
designed to provoke the visitor&rsquo;s interest and admiration and
draw forth frequent ejaculations of surprise. Such a collection
saves wear and tear on the general herbarium and often excites
a real and lasting interest in the ferns. It should contain, of
course, the walking and climbing ferns, the little <i>Schizaea</i>, the
hartstongue, the maidenhair, the cinnamon and sensitive ferns,
etc. Some of the gold and silver ferns might be included, the
star fern is desirable and various species of grape fern will add
to the interest. A few finely cut fronds like that of <i>Dicksonia</i>
may be added, with such other species as suggest themselves on
account of oddity in fruiting. A few fern allies would make a
complete and desirable show herbarium.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>The recent likening, in this journal, of crested and tasseled
fronds to two-headed rabbits has borne fruit in an unexpected
quarter. Certain cultivators of ferns now speak of their stock as
species, varieties and two-headed rabbit sorts!</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>In a recent article on the distribution of <i>Isoetes saccharata</i>,
in the <i>Botanical Gazette</i>, the author notes that <i>I. saccharata</i> is
found only in Chesapeake Bay, while <i>I. riparia</i>, a form that closely
resembles it, is found only in Delaware Bay, and that, notwithstanding
the small differences between the two, there have been
described two intermediate forms, <i>I. saccharata Palmeri</i> and <i>I. s.
reticulata</i>. From this and other facts, he inclines to the belief
that <i>I. riparia</i> is simply an extreme form of <i>saccharata</i>. A
curious circumstance connected with the species and forms is that
specimens collected in a certain locality appeared one season as
the type and the next as the variety. This is not the only instance
on record of <i>Isoetes</i> species intergrading. Mr. A. A. Eaton has
noted that the variety <i>Californica</i> of <i>I. melanopoda</i> intergrades
on the one hand with <i>I. Howelli</i> and on the other with the type,
while specimens referred to <i>I. mexicana</i> by Underwood have since
been identified as <i>I. Orcuttii</i> and <i>I. melanopoda</i>. All this seems
to indicate that the systematists have not yet got hold of the
proper characters upon which to found specific differences, and
there is here a chance for a philosophical botanist to distinguish
himself. It is not enough that the plants look different; the differences
must be specific. All of the forms of <i>Equisetum arvense</i>
look different, but they are not species by any means.</p>
<p class="center">&#8258;</p>
<p>Plans are being made for another meeting of fern students
at St. Louis this winter, during the session of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. There is a prospect of
some excellent papers to be presented, and a large and enthusiastic
meeting is assured. Programs and other information may
be obtained of Prof. N. L. T. Nelson, Central High School, St.
Louis, Mo., or of the editor of <span class="sc">The Fern Bulletin</span>. The editor
expects to be at the meeting and hopes to meet there the majority
of his readers.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">BOOK NEWS.</span></h2>
<p>With two books like &ldquo;Our Ferns in Their Haunts&rdquo; and
&ldquo;How to Know the Ferns&rdquo; in the field, some might think that
the ground is too thoroughly covered to leave room for another,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
but Dr. Waters has proven otherwise in his new volume with the
simple title of &ldquo;Ferns.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
If the older books are taken as books
designed for beginners, the new one may be described as one step
more technical&mdash;a connecting link between popular handbook and
scientific manual. In the matter of information it contains practically
nothing that has not been published before, being
primarily a rearrangement of what is known of our ferns and
bearing internal evidence that the pages of the popular works
above mentioned have supplied much help in its making. This is
especially noticeable in the appropriation of original stanzas from
&ldquo;Our Ferns in Their Haunts,&rdquo; without giving credit for them.
Even when giving credit the author is not always fortunate, as
when he ascribes to Miss Pratt certain lines that are Campbell&rsquo;s.
The book is written from the standpoint of the author&rsquo;s experiences
in the vicinity of Baltimore, and as such cannot always
be taken as representative of ferns and fern habitats in other
parts of our country. The book is also remarkable for the entire
absence of author citations for the generic and specific
names&mdash;in this being unique among American fern books. This
will make it difficult for beginners who use this book to look up
the species elsewhere. The entire subject of the authority for
the names is left untouched in the part that explains why scientific
names are used. There is also evident a disinclination to
give credit for recent work, the usual statement being that such
and such varieties &ldquo;have been described,&rdquo; without noting where
and by whom. Since these descriptions were heretofore to be
found mostly in periodicals, the desirability of mentioning their
place of description is apparent. This much being said in criticism
of the book, there is yet much to praise. The illustrations
are well executed and include a fair proportion of views
in the habitats of the ferns, while the photographs of the sori
enlarged are exceptionally valuable. Anything like them have
never before been published. The analytical key based on the
stipes has been well and carefully worked out. It forms a very
instructive chapter, though such a key will rarely be consulted
by the beginner, because the usual keys are easier. The book
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
is also of interest for the number of varieties or forms included,
many of which are not mentioned in the manuals, and for numerous
photographs illustrating these forms. There is also a
chapter on fern photography. The nomenclature is conservative;
old and well known names having been retained in spite
of recently proposed substitutes. For his stand in this matter
the author is to be greatly commended. The book can in no
sense be considered a rival of others in the field. It fills a place
of its own and as such will be hailed by the fern loving public
as another aid to the proper understanding of this most beautiful
and attractive section of the vegetable kingdom. Type,
paper and presswork all combine to make this a handsome as
well as useful book.</p>
<p>In the making of his &ldquo;Flora of the Southeastern United
States&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Dr. Small has practically worked over anew all the
species of that region and the results of this stupendous undertaking
are now presented in a bulky octavo volume of nearly
fourteen hundred pages. Dr. Chapman&rsquo;s flora of the same
region is fairly conservative, while this one goes to the opposite
extreme, being noticeable for the greatly increased number of
species and an equal lack of what the older book is inclined to
consider varieties or forms. This gives students a choice of
books, but it is probable that a beginner will have much difficulty
in identifying his plants by the aid of the new one, because
of the many closely related forms described as separate
species. The book will appeal more to advanced students
specializing in a few orders or genera. The nomenclature is, of
course, the most radical, even extending beyond the genera and
species to the orders, so that new names are proposed for the
Leguminos&aelig;, Labiat&aelig;, Scrophulariace&aelig; and many others. Along
with the segregation of species there has been a similar splitting
of genera. To the individual familiar with the usual manuals
the book will appear almost like the flora of a foreign land.
The author, however, has been painstaking and conscientious
throughout the work, adhering closely to the ideals prevalent at
New York and a few other centers of botanical activity, and if
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
he has produced a volume that will become the object of much
criticism he has also produced an excellent illustration of what
the recently proposed rules of nomenclature, and new conceptions
of species are capable of when allowed full swing. Although
not agreeing with his conclusions, even conservative botanists
will appreciate the author&rsquo;s consistency and he is to be
congratulated upon the completion of his work. To those who
prefer the less elaborate manual, Dr. Small&rsquo;s book will always
be indispensable for reference.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles T. Druery, well known on this side of the Atlantic
as an enthusiastic cultivator of ferns, has issued a book
devoted principally to British fern varieties, which he has
named &ldquo;The Book of British Ferns.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
In this work he has
been assisted by various members of the British Pteridological
Society, an association similar to our Fern Chapter, and of
which Mr. Druery is president. As is well known the British
fern hunter and fern cultivator is most interested in the abnormal
forms of ferns, and as a result so many of these have been
described that a complete list numbers more than a thousand,
though there were less than seventy-five native species to begin
with. Mr. Druery&rsquo;s task has been to select from this list the
really meritorious varieties from the cultural standpoint. To
this revised list he has added papers on the culture and propagation
of ferns, fern hunting, fern crossing, apospory and kindred
subjects, making a volume which should be of interest to
American readers for the light thrown upon fern life. The book
is well printed and well illustrated, the forms shown being
mostly the more striking varieties.</p>

<h2 id="c22"><span class="small"><span class="ss">A WORD FROM THE EDITOR</span></span></h2>
<p>For more than two years the editor of the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> has also been editing a
journal for the plant-lover, called <span class="sc">The American Botanist</span>. That he has been fairly
successful may be assumed from the fact that it now has the largest circulation of any
botanical magazine in America. People do not buy such publications out of charity; they
buy them for what they contain. No doubt the principal reason for the <span class="sc">American Botanist&rsquo;s</span>
popularity is that it is untechnical&mdash;even those who are not botanists can understand
it. Moreover it deals with a very different side of botany from that usually
presented. If you are interested in plants as living things&mdash;their uses, habits, and curious
methods of getting on in the world&mdash;this is just the publication you want. A large number
of fern students are already readers of the <span class="sc">American Botanist</span>, but to induce others
to become such, we offer the last three numbers for this year, all the numbers of 1904, for
the regular subscription price of $1.00 if received before the first of January. Or we will
send the first five volumes (of six numbers each) and a year&rsquo;s subscription, for $3.00.
With the latter offer, your subscription to the <span class="sc">Fern Bulletin</span> will be renewed for 50
cents additional.</p>

<p>Nearly every fern student seems to have a copy of &ldquo;Our Ferns in Their
Haunts,&rdquo; but if you happen to know of one who doesn&rsquo;t, you could scarcely do
a more graceful thing than to give him one for Christmas. You may be sure
the book will be consulted many times next year and in the years to follow
and every time this happens the giver will be thought of with pleasure. If
you have a young friend who is beginning to get interested in Nature, crystalize
his tendency by giving him this book. The illustrations will make him
a lover of ferns and the text will make him wise about them. There are 225
illustrations and 340 pages of text. No other fern book is so full, so clear or
more accurate. The key for identifying the ferns has illustrations of fruit-dots
and even a child can name the ferns by its use. Sent postpaid upon

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
